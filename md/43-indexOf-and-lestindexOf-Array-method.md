var a =["adnan","arbaaz","fayyaz","arbaaz","mujahid"] ;
document.write(a + "<br>" + "<br>");
var b = a.indexOf("arbaaz",2);
document.write(b);

```
>in this we have two parameter ("value" , start) this is showing that what is the index of your value and if u have to same value then the parameter counts first index first this is why we use start parameter too
