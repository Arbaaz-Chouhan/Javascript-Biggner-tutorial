>in (is-array) we are talking about that the value is array or not if the value is array then the array show us true and if not then they show us false

```javascript
//var  a = ["adnan","arbaaz","fayyaz","mujahid"] ;
var a = 20;
document.write(a +"<br>"+"<br>");

if(Array.isArray(a)){
document.write( "This is an Array");
}else{
    document.write("This is not an Array");
}
```
