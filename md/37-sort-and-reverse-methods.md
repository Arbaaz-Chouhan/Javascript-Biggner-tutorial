> what is sort and reverse array method ?

> first of all we talk about sort 
# SORT( );
> sort stands to make all array sequence vise like wite there first character i explain u ex -> you give a strig array like ("Arbaaz"),("Fayyaz"),("Danis")to you know all alphabate A -> ARBAAZ B C D -> DANIS E F -> FAYYAZ GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
ADNAN FIRST LATTER IS A SO ADANAN RUNS FIRST BUT WE GIVE ADNAN TO 3 BUT IF WE ADD SORT() METHOD THEN ADNAN COME 1ST SAME WITH FAYYAZ AND DANISH SO THE PATTERN TO USE THIS IN INTERNAL 
```javascript
var a = ["Arbaaz","fayyaz","Danis", "Bord"];
document.write(a + "<br>" +"<br>");
a.sort();
if thir are two same charachter name then the name was sorted if thier ar two same charachter name then the name was sorted with thier number example -> adanan have 6 character and 
arbaz have only five so adanan is greter then arbaz so adanan show first
```
# REVERSE( );
>reverse stands ro givea reverse value ex -> if u give string or any kind of data type but in this i give string so we give this value [,"Arbaaz","fayyaz","Danis","Bord"] so if we use reverse method then the value show like that ["barkat","Bord","Danis","Fayyaz","Arbaaz"] so the pattern to use this in input is

```javascript
var a = ["Arbaaz","fayyaz","Danis", "Bord"];
document.write(a);
a.reverse();
document.write(a + "<br>");
```
