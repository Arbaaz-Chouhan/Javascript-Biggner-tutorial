>while loop if we want to write 1 thing in 100 times then we use loops are stands in three step
```javascript
initialize
     |
condition
     |
increment / decrement 
```
### LOOPES
>LOOP IS DIVIDED IN 3 PARTS (INITIALIZATION , CONDITION INCREMENT OR DECREMENT ) 1 -> INITIALIZATION IS HAVE TO MAKE THAT ONE VALUE THAT WE HAVE TO RUN 2 -> CONDITION IF CONDITION IS TRUE THE THIRD PART IS USABLE IF CONDITION IS FALSE THE 3RD PART IS NOT USABLE 3 -> THE THIRD PART IS INCREMNT , DECREMENT IF YOU WANT TO COME UPER TO LOWER THEN USE DECREMENT AND IF U WANT TO COME LOWER TO UPER THE USE INCREMENT THERE ARE FIVE (5) TYPE OF LOOS

so this pa    ttern is to make while loop
```JAVASCRIPT
var a = 1;
while(a <= 10){
    document.write(a + ")hello everyone <br>");
    a = a +1;
    }

    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("<br>");




var a = 10;
while(a >= 1){
    document.write(a + ")hello everyone <br>");
    a = a -1;
}
```
