>first we talk about pop(); ?
# pop();



>if u want to delete last array item then u have use pop(); method example -> ["Arbaaz","Fayyaz","Danis","Bord"] its so like this and if we add pop(); metod then its show like this ["Adnan","Fayyaz","Danis","bord"] barkat was deleted becouse we use pop(); method so the pattern to write this in internal is 
```javascript
var a = ["Arbaaz","fayyaz","Danis", "Bord"];
document.write(a + "<br>" +"<br>");
a.pop();

```
# push();
> push() is oposite brother of pop() becouse we use pop() for delete last value and we use push() for add something at the last so the pattern to write this in internal method

```javascript

var a = ["Arbaaz","fayyaz","Danis", "Bord"];
document.write(a + "<br>" +"<br>");
a.push("Aman");
document.write(a + "<br>" +"<br>");

```
